Looking for a fast, fun math game? Then let's play Mental Math!
Inspired by my middle school math teacher, Mr. Thurlow, Mental Math is a very simple game: follow the operations and get the right answer.

* Preset difficulties allow you to take it slow or speed it up
* Each game mode gets progressively harder, with higher answers and more operations
* Randomly-generated numbers means you'll never play the same game twice
* Play with friends in Group Mode

Mental Math is easy to learn, hard to master, and a blast to play!
